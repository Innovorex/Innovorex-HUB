#### Common Parent Questions

**Q: How do I know my child is actually learning?**
A: Your weekly reports show independent work quality alongside AI-assisted work. We track whether understanding improves over time and require regular demonstration of skills without AI help.

**Q: What if I want my child to use traditional methods only?**
A: You can disable all AI features while keeping administrative benefits like scheduling updates. Your child won't be disadvantaged in any way.

**Q: Is my child's data secure?**
A: Yes. All data remains within your school's secure information systems with the same protections your school has always provided. The AI system adds an additional layer of insights while maintaining all existing security measures. Data is encrypted, never shared with third parties, and follows your school's standard data retention policies.

**Q: Will this make my child dependent on technology?**
A: Our system specifically prevents dependency by gradually reducing AI support as skills improve and requiring regular independent demonstrations.

**Q: How does this prepare my child for college?**
A: Students learn appropriate AI usage, maintain traditional skills, and develop critical thinking about when and how to use AI tools - skills essential for their future.
