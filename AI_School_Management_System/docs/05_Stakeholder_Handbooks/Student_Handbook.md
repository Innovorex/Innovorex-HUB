```
Instead of: "What's the answer to #5?"
Try: "I'm confused about how to approach this type of problem. Can you explain the steps?"

Instead of: "Write my essay about Romeo and Juliet"
Try: "Help me understand the themes in Romeo and Juliet so I can write about them"

Instead of: "Do my math homework"
Try: "I solved this problem but got a different answer than expected. Can you help me check my work?"

Instead of: "Give me facts about the Civil War"
Try: "What are some good questions I should research about the Civil War causes?"
```
