# Risk Register and Management Plan
## AI-Enabled School Management System - Phase 0A

### 🎯 Risk Management Overview

#### Purpose
This document identifies, assesses, and provides mitigation strategies for all risks associated with Phase 0A implementation of the AI-Enabled School Management System.

#### Risk Management Principles
- **Proactive Identification**: Anticipate risks before they become issues
- **Transparent Communication**: Open discussion of risks with stakeholders
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular risk assessment and status updates
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage stakeholders in risk identification and mitigation
- **Adaptive Response**: Flexible strategies that adjust to changing conditions

#### Risk Assessment Criteria

  1: Very Low (0-10% chance)
  2: Low (11-30% chance)
  3: Medium (31-50% chance)
  4: High (51-80% chance)
  5: Very High (81-100% chance)

Impact Scale (1-5):
  1: Very Low (minimal impact on project)
