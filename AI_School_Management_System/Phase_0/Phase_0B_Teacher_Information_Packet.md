### ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Will this replace me as a teacher?
**A:** Absolutely not. You remain the educational expert, decision-maker, and relationship-builder. AI handles routine tasks so you can focus on what you do best: inspiring and teaching students.

#### Q: What if the AI gives students wrong information?
**A:** All AI responses are based on your approved content and teaching style. You can review interactions, correct information, and the AI learns from your corrections. Students also learn to verify information critically.

#### Q: How much extra work will this create?
**A:** Initially, you'll spend time learning the system (we estimate 10-15 hours over 2 months). However, the AI will save you 5-8 hours per week on administrative tasks, creating a net time savings.

#### Q: What about students who become dependent on AI?
**A:** The system includes built-in independence building. AI assistance gradually decreases as students demonstrate mastery, and regular independent work is required to ensure skill development.

#### Q: Can I opt out if I don't like it?
**A:** Yes. You can disable AI features, return to traditional methods, or withdraw from the pilot at any time. Your teaching position and effectiveness are not dependent on AI usage.

#### Q: How does this affect my autonomy in the classroom?
**A:** It enhances your autonomy by giving you more time and better information for decision-making. All AI suggestions require your approval, and you maintain complete control over your classroom.
