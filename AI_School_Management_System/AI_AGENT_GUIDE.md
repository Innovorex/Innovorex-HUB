## ðŸŽ¯ How AI Agent Works

### **Step 1: Intent Detection**
The AI analyzes your message to understand what you want to do.

### **Step 2: Information Extraction**
It extracts relevant data from your message (names, dates, amounts, etc.).

### **Step 3: Missing Information**
If required information is missing, the AI asks for it:
```
User: "Add a new student John"
AI: "I need a few more details:
     â€¢ Email address
     â€¢ Gender
     â€¢ Date of birth"
```

### **Step 4: Confirmation**
Before executing, the AI confirms the action:
```
AI: "Ready to create student with:
     â€¢ Name: John Doe
     â€¢ Email: john@school.com
     â€¢ Gender: Male
     â€¢ DOB: 2005-06-15

     Shall I proceed?"
```

### **Step 5: Execution**
Upon confirmation, the action is executed and you get immediate feedback.

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Features

### **Multi-Step Workflows**
The AI can handle complex, multi-step tasks:
```
"Create a new Computer Science program, then add Introduction to Programming course,
and assign it to Dr. Smith"
```

### **Bulk Operations**
Handle multiple items at once:
```
"Mark all students in Section A present for today's Physics class"
```

### **Smart Defaults**
The AI applies intelligent defaults when appropriate:
```
"Create new student Mary"
(AI will default to current academic year, active status, etc.)
```

### **Error Recovery**
If an action fails, the AI provides helpful guidance:
```
AI: "Unable to create user - email already exists.
     Would you like to update the existing user instead?"
```
